This program generates 100 random weather measurements incl. random TimeDate, random cloud cover, random temperature, random wind direction and speed and random humidity, 
and sorts the data based on the latest measurement date.
Additionally, Cloud Cover and Wind Derection are represented by Enums.
The program instanciates 100 measurements into a generic list, and displays them in the console.
Serialization is implemented by means of an interface.
Next, it serializes the data into a .csv file.
The program can also deserializes data from the same .csv file. The regional separator used for a .csv file is semicolon.
